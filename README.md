# bellhop

# Setup

1. On your Octatrack card, create a new set called `LOBBY`. This should be located at the root of the card.
2. Enter USB mode.
3. On your Octatrack, clone this repository here: `/LOBBY/.git`
4. Work on the Octatrack as you you normally would.
5. Push changes via git like you normally would.

#Purpose

bellhop works in conjunction with [bouncer](https://github.com/northern-information/bouncer).

bellhop handles octatrack project files and ignores `.wav` files.

bouncer handles `.wav` files via dropbox.
